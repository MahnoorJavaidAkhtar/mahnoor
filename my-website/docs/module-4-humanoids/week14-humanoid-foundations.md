# Week 14 — Humanoid Robotics Foundations 🤖🦿✨

Humanoid robotics is one of the most challenging, fascinating, and futuristic fields in robotics.  
Humanoids are robots designed to resemble human body structure:

- a torso  
- two legs  
- two arms  
- a head  
- multi-axis joints  
- balance & locomotion abilities  

This week covers the **structure, physics, balance, actuators, and kinematics** of humanoids.

## 1. What Is a Humanoid Robot? 🤖✨

A humanoid robot is a robot with:

- legged locomotion  
- arms for manipulation  
- a torso for stability  
- a head for sensors  
- human-like proportions  

Examples:

- Atlas (Boston Dynamics)  
- Digit (Agility Robotics)  
- Figure 01  
- Tesla Optimus  

---

## 2. Why Build Humanoid Robots? 🧠✨

Because they can:

- operate in human environments  
- use human tools  
- walk on stairs  
- navigate uneven terrain  
- replace repetitive labor  

Humanoids are the future of:

- logistics  
- elder care  
- manufacturing  
- home assistance

## 3. Humanoid Body Structure 🔧🦿

Typical structure:

Torso
├── Left Arm
├── Right Arm
├── Left Leg
└── Right Leg
Head

## 4. Degrees of Freedom (DOF) 🎛️

Humanoids have **20–40 DOF**.

Example DOF distribution:

- legs → 6 DOF each  
- arms → 7 DOF each  
- torso → 1–3 DOF  
- head → 2–3 DOF  

---

## 5. Humanoid Joint Types 🔩

Joints include:

- hip pitch, roll, yaw  
- knee pitch  
- ankle pitch, roll  
- shoulder pitch, roll, yaw  
- elbow pitch  
- wrist joints  

---

## 6. Humanoid Kinematic Chain 🔗🤖

pelvis → hip → thigh → knee → shin → ankle → foot

yaml
Copy code

This chain defines leg movement.

---

## 7. Forward Kinematics (FK) ➡️🦿

FK calculates:

joint angles → foot position

yaml
Copy code

Used for balance and stepping.

---

## 8. Inverse Kinematics (IK) 🔄

IK calculates:

desired foot position → required joint angles

yaml
Copy code

Essential for:

- stepping  
- manipulation  
- reaching motions  

---

## 9. Center of Mass (CoM) ⚖️

The CoM must remain:

- above support polygon  
- inside stability region  

If CoM goes outside → robot falls.

---

## 10. Zero Moment Point (ZMP) 🌀👣

ZMP is the most important stability metric.

If ZMP stays inside the foot support area → robot stays stable.

---

## 11. Support Polygon 🦶🔷

Generated by feet contact points.

Standing:

Left Foot + Right Foot = Large Polygon

java
Copy code

Single support (one foot):

Small Polygon → harder balance

Copy code

---

## 12. Balance Control Loop 🔁🤖

IMU → state estimate → controller → torque → stability

yaml
Copy code

---

## 13. Sensors in Humanoids 👁️🧭📡

Common sensors:

- IMU → balance  
- cameras → vision  
- LiDAR → mapping  
- torque sensors → manipulation  
- foot contact sensors → gait stability  

---

## 14. Actuators for Humanoids 🔋🦿

Actuators must be:

- strong  
- responsive  
- lightweight  

Types:

- electric motors  
- harmonic drives  
- series elastic actuators (SEA)  
- hydraulic actuators  

---

## 15. Series Elastic Actuators (SEA) 🌟

Perfect for:

- safe human interaction  
- shock absorption  
- smooth walking  

---

## 16. Foot Contact Modeling 👣💥

Foot-ground interaction must consider:

- friction  
- slip  
- penetration  
- impact absorption  

---

## 17. Whole-Body Control (WBC) 🤖✨

WBC coordinates:

- legs  
- arms  
- torso  
- head  

All simultaneously.

---

## 18. Dynamic Stability ⚡🏃‍♂️

Dynamic balance uses:

- momentum  
- ZMP tracking  
- CoM trajectory planning  

---

## 19. Humanoid Walking Difficulty 😅🦿

Humanoid walking is hard because:

- it’s dynamically unstable  
- multibody physics  
- precise timing  
- high DOF  

---

## 20. Torso Control 🧍‍♂️✨

The torso stabilizes:

- posture  
- upper body balance  
- overall CoM  

---

## 21. Joint Compliance 🎛️⚡

Compliance allows:

- soft movement  
- shock buffering  
- natural motion patterns  

---

## 22. Humanoid Fall Detection 🚨🤖

Uses:

- IMU thresholds  
- angular velocity  
- CoM tracking  

---

## 23. Recovery After Falling 🔄🦿

Robots must:

- switch modes  
- go into safe posture  
- reorient  
- stand up  

---

## 24. Standing Up Motion Sequence ↗️🤖

Sequence:

1. roll to side  
2. push torso upward  
3. move legs under body  
4. rise to standing  

---

## 25. Energy Efficiency in Humanoids 🔋💡

Walking requires:

- smart joint trajectories  
- compliant control  
- reduction of internal friction  

---

## 26. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) 🤝✨

Humanoids must:

- move safely  
- respond to humans  
- understand gestures  
- maintain comfortable distance  

---

## 27. Safety in Humanoid Robotics 🛡️🤖

Safety concerns:

- collision avoidance  
- force limits  
- compliant actuators
